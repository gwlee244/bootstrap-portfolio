                        <p id="p1">I was born in Toronto, Canada and moved to the United States when I was 5 years old.  I was raised in the town of Trumbull, CT where I played baseball and soccer through high school.  I attended the University of Connecticut and graduated with an Anthropology degree.  During college I was in the Army ROTC program.  Upon graduation I was commissioned as an Army officer.  I served as a combat engineer in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Missouri.  I was able to experience many exciting things such as demolitions, mine clearing operations, and urban warfare training.</p>

                        <p id="p2">Upon leaving the military I worked for a small IT consulting company in Connecticut.  I was trained as a Windows Administrator. After a year I joined IBM as a Backup and Recovery Administrator.  I performed this role for a year and then moved into SAN/Storage where I have remained for the past 15 years in various capacities ranging from team lead to storage integration manager.  Currently I am pursuing a career in software development.  My hobbies include playing soccer, softball, and military model making.  My wife Amy and I have 5 year old twins, Henry and Nora, and we reside in Apex, NC.</p>
